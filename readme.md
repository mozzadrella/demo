# Learning Objectives

* Remotes
* Push
* Pull
* Branching

## Branches are at the heart of the Git workflow

* Pointers to commits
* Those pointers can change
* Bookmark on our local machine vs. our bookmark in the cloud over the wire "remote"

## What tool are you using to visualize your commits?

* I use Fork, which you can find at https://git-fork.com/
* There are other tools out there, I just like this one.
